SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Facebook::API;

        # @ENV{qw/WFA_API_KEY WFA_SECRET_KEY WFA_DESKTOP/} are the initial values,
        # so use those if you only have one app and don't want to pass in values
        # to constructor
        my $client = WWW::Facebook::API->new(
            desktop => 0,
            api_key => 'your api key',
            secret => 'your secret key',
        );
    
        # Change API key and secret
        print "Enter your public API key: ";
        chomp( my $val = <STDIN> );
        $client->api_key($val);
        print "Enter your API secret: ";
        chomp($val = <STDIN> );
        $client->secret($val);
    
        # not needed if web app (see $client->canvas->get_fb_params)

        my $quotes_perl = $client->users->get_info(
            uids   => $friends_perl,
            fields => ['quotes']
        );

        $client->auth->logout;

DESCRIPTION
    A Perl implementation of the Facebook API, working off of the canonical
    Java and PHP implementations. By default it uses JSON::Any to parse the
    response returned by Facebook's server. There is an option to return the
    raw response in either XML or JSON (See the "parse" method below). As
    the synopsis states, the following environment variables are used to set
    the defaults for new instances:

        WFA_API_KEY
        WFA_SESSION_KEY
        WFA_DESKTOP

    Additionally, for each instance that is created, the following
    environment variables are used if no values are set:

        WFA_API_KEY_APP_PATH
        WFA_SESSION_KEY_APP_PATH
        WFA_DESKTOP_APP_PATH

    Where "APP_PATH" is replaced by whatever $client->app_path returns, with
    all non-alphanumeric characters replaced with an underscore and all
    characters upcased (e.g., foo-bar-baz becomes FOO_BAR_BAZ).

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new( %params )
        Returns a new instance of this class. You are able to pass in any of
        the attribute method names in WWW::Facebook::API to set its value:

            my $client = WWW::Facebook::API->new(
                parse           => 1,
                format          => 'JSON',
                secret          => 'application_secret_key',
                api_key         => 'application_key',
                session_key     => 'session_key',
                session_expires => 'session_expires',
                session_uid     => 'session_uid',
                desktop         => 1,
                api_version     => '1.0',
                callback        => 'callback_url',
                next            => 'next',
                popup           => 'popup',
                skipcookie      => 'skip_cookie',
            );
            $copy = $client->new;

NAMESPACE METHODS
    All method names from the Facebook API are lower_cased instead of
    CamelCase.

    auth
        For desktop apps, these are synonymous:

            $client->auth->get_session( $client->auth->create_token );
            $client->auth->get_session;

        And that's all you really have to do (but see
        WWW::Facebook::API::Auth for details about opening a browser on *nix
        for Desktop apps). "get_session" automatically sets "session_uid",
        "session_key", and "session_expires" for $client. It returns
        nothing.

        If the desktop attribute is set to false the $token must be the
        auth_token returned from Facebook to your web app for that user:

            if ( $q->param('auth_token')  ) {
                $client->auth->get_session( $q->param('auth_token') );
            }

        "get_session" automatically sets "session_uid", "session_key", and
        "session_expires" for $client. It returns nothing.

        See WWW::Facebook::API::Auth for details.

    canvas
        Work with the canvas. See WWW::Facebook::API::Canvas.

            $response = $client->canvas->get_user( $q )
            $response = $client->canvas->get_fb_params( $q )
            $response = $client->canvas->get_non_fb_params( $q )
            $response = $client->canvas->validate_sig( $q )
            $response = $client->canvas->in_fb_canvas( $q )

            );

ATTRIBUTE METHODS
    These are methods to get/set the object's attributes.

    api_key( $new_api_key )
        The developer's API key. If $ENV{'WFA_API_KEY'} is set, all
        instances will be initialized with its value. See the Facebook API
        documentation for more information.

    api_version( $new_version )
        Which version to use (default is "1.0", which is the only one
        supported currently. Corresponds to the argument "v" that is passed
        in to methods as a parameter.

    app_path()
        If using the Facebook canvas, the path to your application. For
        example if your application is at http://apps.facebook.com/example/
        this should be "example".

    apps_uri()
        The apps uri for Facebook apps. The default is
        http://apps.facebook.com/.

    callback( $new_default_callback )
        The callback URL for your application. See the Facebook API
        documentation. Just a convenient place holder for the value.

    call_success( $is_success, $error_message )
        Takes in two values, the first setting the object's
        last_call_success attribute, and the second setting the object's
        last_error attribute. Returns an array reference containing the
        last_call_success and last_error values, in that order:

            my $response = $client->call_success( 1, undef );
            if ( $response->[0] == 1 ) {
                print 'Last call successful';
            }
            if ( not defined $response->[1] ) {
                print 'Error message is undefined';
            }

            $client->call_success( 0,'2: The service is not available at this time.');

            $response = $client->call_success;
            if ( not $response->[0] ) {
                print 'Last call unsuccessful';
            }
            if ( not defined $response->[1] ) {
                print "Error $response->[1]";
            }

        The "call" method calls this method, and shouldn't need to be called
        to set anything, just to get the value later if "throw_errors" is
        false.

    debug(0|1)
        A boolean set to either true or false, determining if debugging
        messages should be carped for REST calls. Defaults to 0.

    desktop(0|1)
        A boolean signifying if the client is being used for a desktop
        application. If $ENV{'WFA_DESKTOP'} is set, all instances will be
        initialized with its value. Defaults to 0 otherwise. See the
        Facebook API documentation for more information.

    format('JSON'|'XML')
        The default format to use if none is supplied with an API method
        call. Currently available options are XML and JSON. Defaults to
        JSON.

    last_call_success(1|0)
        A boolean set to true or false, to show whether the last call was
        succesful or not. Called by "call_success". Defaults to 1.

    last_error( $error_message )
        A string holding the error message of the last failed call to the
        REST server. Called by "call_success". Defaults to undef.

    next( $new_default_next_url )
        See the Facebook API documentation's Authentication Guide. Just a
        convenient place holder for the value.

    parse(1|0)
        Defaults to 1. If set to true, the response returned by each method
        call will be a Perl structure (see each method for the structure it
        will return). If it is set to 0, the response string from the server
        will be returned. (The response string is unescaped if the 'desktop'
        attribute is false).

    popup( $popup )
        See the Facebook API documentation's Authentication Guide. Just a
        convenient place holder for the value.

    query( $query )
        Stores the current query object to use (either CGI or
        Apache::Request) but really anything that implements the "param()"
        method can be used. N.B. When using "require_*" methods below,
        Apache::Request will croak because it does not implement a redirect
        method.

    secret( $new_secret_key )
        For a desktop application, this is the secret that is used for
        calling "auth-"create_token> and "auth-"get_session>. For a web
        application, secret is used for all calls to the API. If
        $ENV{'WFA_SECRET_KEY'} is set, all instances will be initialized
        with its value. See the Facebook API documentation under
        Authentication for more information.

    server_uri( $new_server_uri )
        The server uri to access the Facebook REST server. Default is
        'http://api.facebook.com/restserver.php'. Used to make calls to the
        Facebook server, and useful for testing. See the Facebook API
        documentation.

    session_expires( $new_expires )
        The session expire timestamp for the client's user. Automatically
        set when "$client-"auth->get_session> is called. See the Facebook
        API documentation.

    session_key( $new_key )
        The session key for the client's user. Automatically set when
        "<$client-"auth->get_session>> is called. See the Facebook API
        documentation.

    session_uid( $new_uid )
        The session's uid for the client's user. Automatically set when
        "<$client-"auth->get_session>> is called. See the Facebook API
        documentation.

    skipcookie(0|1)
        See the Facebook API documentation's Authentication Guide. Just a
        convenient place holder for the value.

    throw_errors(0|1)
        A boolean set to either true of false, signifying whether or not to
        "confess" when an error is returned from the REST server.

    ua  The LWP::UserAgent agent used to communicate with the REST server.
        The agent_alias is initially set to "Perl-WWW-Facebook-API/0.3.9".

PUBLIC METHODS
    call( $method, %args )
        The method which other submodules within WWW::Facebook::API use to
        call the Facebook REST interface. It takes in a string signifying
        the method to be called (e.g., 'auth.getSession'), and key/value
        pairs for the parameters to use: $client->call( 'auth.getSession',
        auth_token => 'b3324235e' );

    generate_sig( params => $params_hashref, secret => $secret )
        Generates a sig when given a parameters hash reference and a secret
        key.

    get_add_url( %params )
        Returns the URL to add your application with the parameters (that
        are given) included. Note that the API key and the API version
        parameters are also included automatically. If the "next" parameter
        is passed in, it's string-escaped. Used for platform applications:

            $response = $client->get_add_url( next => 'http://my.website.com' );

            # prints http://www.facebook.com/app.php?api_key=key&v=1.0
            #        &next=http%3A%2F%2Fmy.website.com
            print $response;

    get_app_url
        Returns the URL to your application, if using the Facebook canvas.
        Uses <$client->app_path>, which you have to set yourself (See
        <app_path> below).

    get_facebook_url( $subdomain )
        Returns the URL to Facebook. You can specifiy a specific network as
        a parameter:

            $response = $client->get_facebook_url( 'apps' );
            print $response;    # prints http://apps.facebook.com

    get_infinite_session_url()
        Returns the URL for the user to generate an infinite session for
        your application:

            $response = $client->get_infinite_session_url;

            # prints http://www.facebook.com/codegen.php?api_key=key&v=1.0
            print $response;

        From what I've seen, the session keys that Facebook returns don't
        expire automatically, so as long as you don't call
        $client->auth->logout, you shouldn't even need to worry about this.

    get_login_url( %params )
        Returns the URL to login to your application with the parameters
        (that are defined) included. If the "next" parameter is passed in,
        it's string-escaped:

            $response = $client->get_login_url( next => 'http://my.website.com' );

            # prints http://www.facebook.com/login.php?api_key=key&v=1.0
            #        &next=http%3A%2F%2Fmy.website.com
            print $response;

    get_url( $type, @args )
        Called by all the above "get_*_url" methods above. $type can be
        'login', 'app', 'add', 'facebook', or 'infinite_session'. @args is
        either a scalar (in the case when $type is 'facebook') or a hash.
        All of these "get_*_url" methods correspond to the ones in the
        official PHP client.

    log_string($params_hashref, $response)
        Pass in the params and the response from a call, and it will make a
        formatted string out of it showing the parameters used, and the
        response received.

    redirect( $url, $query_object )
        Called by "require()" to redirect the user either within the canvas
        or without. This, as with "require()" is only really useful when
        having a web app. If no <$query_object> is defined, then whatever is
        in "$self-"query> will be used. (See WWW::Facebook::API::Canvas)

    require_add( $query )
        Redirects the user to what "get_add_url()" returns. See "require()"
        below for the $query parameter.

    require_frame( $query )
        Redirects the user to what "get_login_url( canvas =" '1' )> returns.
        See "require()" below for the $query parameter.

    require_login( $query )
        Redirects the user to what "get_login_url()" returns. See
        "require()" below for the $query parameter.

    require( $what, $query )
        The official PHP client has "require_*" methods that take no
        arguments. Logically, you better know what you want to require when
        you call each of them, so this API consolidates them into one
        method. The valid values for $what are 'add', 'frame', and 'login'.
        $query is the query object to use (most likely CGI). If $query is
        undefined, the value of "$self-"query> is used.

    session( uid => $uid, key => $session_key, expires => $session_expires )
        Sets the "user", "session_key", and "session_expires" all at once.

    unescape_string($escaped_string)
        Returns its parameter with all the escape sequences unescaped. If
        you're using a web app, this is done automatically to the response.

    verify_sig( sig => $expected_sig, params => $params_hashref )
        Checks the signature for a given set of parameters against an
        expected value.

PRIVATE METHODS
    _add_url_params( %params )
        Called by both "get_login_url" and "get_add_url" to process any of
        their parameters. Prepends the api_key and the version number as
        parameters and returns the parameter string.

    _check_values_of($params_hashref)
        Makes sure all the values of the $params_hashref that need to be set
        are set. Uses the defaults for those values that are needed and not
        supplied.

    _format_params($params_hashref)
        Format parameters according to Facebook API specification.

    _post_request( $params_hashref, $secret )
        Used by "call" to post the request to the REST server and return the
        response.

    _parse($string)
        Parses the response from a call to the Facebook server to make it a
        Perl data structure, and returns the result.

    _parser()
        Returns a new instance of JSON::Any.

DIAGNOSTICS
    "Unable to load JSON module for parsing: %s"
        JSON::Any was not able to load one of the JSON modules it uses to
        parse JSON. Please make sure you have one (of the several) JSON
        modules it can use installed.

    "Error during REST call: %s"
        This means that there's most likely an error in the server you are
        using to communicate to the Facebook REST server. Look at the
        traceback to determine why an error was thrown. Double-check that
        "server_uri" is set to the right location.

    "Cannot create namespace %s: %s"
        Cannot create the needed subclass method. Contact the developer to
        report.

    "Cannot create attribute %s: %s"
        Cannot create the needed attribute method. Contact the developer to
        report.

    "Cannot redirect without redirect method!"
        You're not using CGI as a query object when calling "redirect()" (or
        one of the "require_*" methods. The query object you're using must
        implement the "redirect()" method as CGI does.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    WWW::Facebook::API requires no configuration files or environment
    variables.

DEPENDENCIES
    version Crypt::SSLeay Digest::MD5 JSON::Any Time::HiRes LWP::UserAgent

INCOMPATIBILITIES

TESTING
    There are some live tests included, but they are only run if the
    following environment variables are set: WFA_API_KEY_TEST
    WFA_SECRET_KEY_TEST WFA_SESSION_KEY_TEST

    Additionally, if your app is a desktop one, you must set
    "WFA_DESKTOP_TEST". Also, the session key must be valid for the API key
    being used.

    With live tests enabled, here is the current test coverage:
